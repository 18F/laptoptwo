This document is about how to contribute to this codebase. This process looks a bit different depending on whether you’re a member of the public, an 18F employee, or a member of the outreach or site team. 

The [README](README.md) has some notes at the end about contributing; see those first.

- [Public contributions](#public-contributions)
- [Internal (18F) Contributions](#internal-18f-contributions)
- [Public domain](#public-domain)

No matter who you are, if you spot an error, omission, or bug, you're welcome to open an issue in this repo!

## Public contributions

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to an 18F open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just [send us an email](mailto:18f@gsa.gov) with your question — or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follow the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and all contributors should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

* If you see an error or have feedback, the best way to let us know is to file an issue.
* To contribute a specific change to the site, outside contributors will need to fork this repo.

## Internal (18F) Contributions

Probably the same, no? Issues, pull requests, or if you want to help maintain, drop a note.

## Public domain

For detailed license information, see [LICENSE](LICENSE.md).

All contributions to this project will be released under the CC0 dedication. By submitting a pull request, you are agreeing to comply with this waiver of copyright interest.
